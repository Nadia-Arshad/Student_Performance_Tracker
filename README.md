# Student_Performance_Tracker
Python project to manage student performance and track grades

This is a program that takes the names and scores of three subjects (Math, English, Science), tells you the average marks of that student for these subjects and then calculates the average of the class as well and feedback in the end. 

## How to Use this program:
- Open the `.ipynb` file on Colab.
- Add student names and their scores for three subjects.
- The program will calculate the average score for each student and then the class average.

## Files:
- `student_performance_tracker.ipynb`: Jupyter/Colab notebook for the project.
- `student_performance_tracker.py`: From VS code for the project.

## Requirements:
- Latest version of python installed on your pc/laptop.
- If using Jupyter or Colab, simply run the cells in sequence.

## Installation:
 - Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/Student_Performance_Tracker.git`
 - Open the notebook in Jupyter or run the Python script directly.
